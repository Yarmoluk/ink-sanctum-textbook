## Concept Generation Readiness Assessment

### Topic Breadth Analysis
The 12 main topics provide excellent breadth across:
- **Biological/physiological concepts** (wound healing, skin structure, inflammation)
- **Procedural concepts** (washing techniques, moisturizing protocols, timing)
- **Product knowledge** (soaps, ointments, lotions, SPF products)
- **Decision-making frameworks** (normal vs. abnormal, when to seek help)
- **Personalization concepts** (body area considerations, health factors)
- **Prevention concepts** (infection, sun damage, complications)

### Bloom's Taxonomy Diversity
All six cognitive levels are well-represented with 4 outcomes each (24 total outcomes), suggesting diverse concept types:
- Factual concepts (Remember level)
- Conceptual understanding (Understand level)
- Procedural knowledge (Apply level)
- Analytical frameworks (Analyze level)
- Evaluative criteria (Evaluate level)
- Synthesis and creation (Create level)
